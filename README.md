## Description

In this project, I went through several steps including generating two-digit sequences of images and also implementing several models to classifiy them
The required steps for this project are as follows: <br/>
1- generating a two-digit mnist dataset ( to classifiy images into 11 classes (mnist has 10 classes and blank class) <br/>
2- implementing a CNN model (custom-model-with-batchnormalization)<br/>
3- implementing a CNN-LSTM model<br/>

To get an overview of the models' architecture, I have included the model visualizations in the Images folder. Needless to say,
I visualized my models using Netron which is a viewer for neural networks.
